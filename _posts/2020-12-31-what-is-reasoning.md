title: What is Reasoning?
---

In some problems the representations are crisp. Here are some examples: Mathematics, programming, games such as Chess or Go, and planning problems such as "Block's World" or Rubik's cube. We generally refer to the cognitive processes required to solve these problems as reasoning.

However, the term reasoning is also used in other contexts. For example scientists need to decide what experiments to run, which requires the sort of deliberate reflection we refer to as reasoning. Investors need to make decisions about what outcomes are likely and need to make investment decisions accordingly. People of all sorts are constantly engaged in social reasoning about the people they interact with also known as "Theory of Mind".

We might call the first kind of problem a *crisp reasoning* problem to distinguish it from the more general notion of reasoning. The term reasoning can in general be applied to any form of cognitive processing in which a *sequence* of decisions, thoughts or manipulations are made in the service of a larger goal. In humans this processing tends to be slow and reflective. Even if reasoning tasks can sometimes be performed quickly they often benefit from the application of more time. For example, speed chess is possible, but if more time is allowed for decision making the level of play is higher.

One thing I want to argue that may seem counterintuitive is that crisp reasoning and program synthesis are one and the same problem.
