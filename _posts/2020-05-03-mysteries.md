I used to spend a lot of time thinking about mysteries. Thinking perhaps though is not the right word, because these mysteries are often so beyond comprehension that they don’t provide the handholds that thinking requires.

It’s interesting that the deepest is also the simplest: Why does anything exist at all?

If you truly contemplate this question it can pay a strange dividend. You realize that magic really exists. Or at least a natural order so strange and beautiful that it might as well be magic.

The fact that anything exists points at an infinity in the heart of nature. 

Firstly it makes a mockery of our conventional notion of time. I’ll use the word Everything to mean “all that is”, rather than universe or multiverse which have their own meanings.
Everything can’t have truly had a beginning. At least not in the conventional sense as a distinct moment in time where things began. To suppose that would require us to explain what caused this beginning. This of course leads to an infinite regress. 

Our own universe seems to have had a beginning, but surely our universe is part of a larger process, as is already implied by our best explanations of Everything. 

Somehow Everything must be woven as an infinite tapestry with no beginning and no end. I find this to be a tremendously comforting idea.
