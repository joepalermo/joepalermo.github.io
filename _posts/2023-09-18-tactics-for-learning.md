If you have ambitious goals you'll probably need to learn a lot to accomplish them. Here are some tactics I've found to be helpful in guiding my own learning.

**Learn from projects.**

I love textbooks and other concentrations of knowledge, but there are downsides to bottom-up learning. Mainly it's just not nearly as fun as top-down learning! Top-down learning is where you start with a goal - something that you can feel motivated to accomplish, then learn what you need depth-wise as you make progress towards your goal. Reading a textbook from cover to cover is a form of bottom-up learning because you are starting with raw content and making absorption of that content the objective. The learning process in that case is directed by someone else (the author of the book) and for many people will be harder to sustain over long periods of time. For me it has been most productive to learn top-down with projects, and to read from textbooks/papers selectively in the service of my goals.

**Embrace active recall and spaced repetition.**

Reading is only the first step on the path of learning. After you've read something you should try to re-derive it yourself. If it's important you should re-derive it periodically by using a system such as [Anki](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) to automatically and efficiently schedule your reviews. You only understand something if you can create it and explain it from scratch, i.e. you have a generative model of that concept in your mind.
