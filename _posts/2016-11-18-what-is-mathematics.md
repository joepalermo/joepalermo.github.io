title: "What is Mathematics"

Most people who study math, even advanced math, don’t generally think much about the philosophical foundations of the field. A few years ago I became briefly obsessed with this topic. When I dug into it I realized that it’s actually quite simple.

In brief, one can say that mathematics is nothing more than the consequences of axioms. An axiom is a primitive rule that we just accept as a starting point. For example, people generally just accept the rules of arithmetic as a starting point without trying to prove that they’re correct. Other common axioms make statements about the properties of sets, functions, and other higher-order mathematical objects.

As a side note, it’s kind of cool to know that it’s actually possible to start with yet more primitive axioms and then derive from them the rules of arithmetic. In this vein, hundreds of pages of Bertrand Russell’s Principia Mathematica are required to build up to a proof that 1 + 1 = 2.

Once a collection of axioms has been selected, the purpose of mathematics is to work out the consequences. Theorems are mathematical statements that are implied by the axioms. In order to establish a theorem, you have to prove its correctness by tying together statements that follow only from the axioms, or from other theorems that you have already proved.

That’s it!
