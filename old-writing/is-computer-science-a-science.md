Should computer science be considered a ‘science’? I don’t think so. In saying that I’m not trying to put computer science down, but rather frame it with respect to other disciplines.

Obviously, any such opinion hinges on one’s definition of ‘science’. Thus, if my definition of ‘science’ doesn’t agree with your sense of aesthetics, you likely won’t agree with this post.

A discipline will be considered a ‘science’ if it requires empirical observation of the universe. That is, it can’t be done even in principle unless the capability to observe nature exists.

A more tellling name than ‘science’ for such disciplines would be ’empirical systems theory’, to be contrasted with the other major category of disciplines, which I will call ‘formal systems theory’ (which is really just mathematics).

Clearly you can’t do proper physics unless you can do experiments. And the same is true of all the sciences, as I have defined the term. The results of ‘science’ hinge on unknown properties of the universe which are vetted out over time via experimentation.

What about computer science? Unfortunately, there seems to be fairly widespread confusion in the general public concerning what computer science really is. I have the impression that most people think computer science is about computers, which is actually quite far from the truth. Famous computer scientist, Edsger Dijkstra, once said: “computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.” What computer science actually studies is computation itself. It just so happens that in practice, computation is performed by computers. That is, we use computers to do computation.

In order to classify computer science I’ll have to make a distinction between how computer science functions in practice and how it could function in principle. In practice, computer science is definitely empirical in some sense because computer scientists build computer programs to test their ideas. However a computer is just a tool for doing computation, and people can do computation with pencils and paper. Thus in principle, computer science can be done without any observational experiments.

So computer science isn’t a science. Rather, it is a kind of ‘formal systems theory’. In other words, it is a sub-field of mathematics.

A clear consequence of this discussion is that there is an important in-principle difference between mathematics and science. Although math is used heavily in science, and science (especially physics) often inspires purely mathematical work, they are epistemically a world apart.

A person, living in a bland room buried miles underground can still make unlimited progress in “formal systems theory”, despite their disadvantaged location. On the other hand, they can’t do a lick of physics.

One can say that computer science studies the idealized ‘universes’ that can be built inside of computers. Because these ‘universes’ are idealized, they can be formalized with the language of mathematics. In light of this, perhaps computer science could use a new name, perhaps one reminiscent of the term ‘mathematics’. Personally I like the term ‘informatics’.
