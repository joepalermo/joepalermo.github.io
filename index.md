## Hi, I'm Joe.

Professionally I'm a deep learning engineer and researcher.

I was one of the creators of [RealTalk](https://joepalermo.github.io/2020/01/01/real-talk.html), which was at the time of its release a state-of-the-art speech synthesis demo. It was featured by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/the-weekly/deepfake-joe-rogan.html), [Vice](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/597yba/ai-generated-fake-joe-rogan-voice-dessa), [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629024/joe-rogan-ai-fake-voice-clone-deepfake-dessa), [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/this-ai-generated-joe-rogan-voice-sounds-eerily-like-th-1834842151), and others. As a result I was invited to [speak at TEDxToronto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXBBalHl_cI) on the implications of deep fakes.
