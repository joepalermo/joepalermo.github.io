## Hi, I'm Joe.

I'm a machine learning engineer at [Dessa](https://dessa.com), where I build machine learning systems for some of the world's largest enterprises.

I'm also one of the creators of the [RealTalk](https://medium.com/@dessa_/realtalk-how-it-works-94c1afda62f0) project, a state-of-the-art speech synthesis system. It was featured in publications such as [Vice](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/597yba/ai-generated-fake-joe-rogan-voice-dessa), [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629024/joe-rogan-ai-fake-voice-clone-deepfake-dessa), and [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/this-ai-generated-joe-rogan-voice-sounds-eerily-like-th-1834842151), among others.
